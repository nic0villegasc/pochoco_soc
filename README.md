# Pochoco SoC & Espino Core

> Meet Pochoco SoC and Espino Core. Inspired by the native flora of the Pochoco trails, it is an entry-level, highly efficient architecture designed to flourish in resource-constrained environments.

Welcome to the repository! This project contains the RTL for a custom 32-bit processor and its surrounding System-on-Chip (SoC) designed for FPGA deployment. The design is kept straightforward to help explore and understand computer architecture fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

The hardware is written in Verilog and divided into these main categories:

* **The Espino Core**: The central processing unit. It includes all standard pipeline stages like instruction fetch, instruction decode, an ALU for execution, a register file, a load/store unit for memory operations, and a pipeline controller.
* **The Pochoco SoC**: The top-level system wrapper. It connects the CPU core to a unified instruction/data RAM, physical board peripherals (like LEDs, switches, and displays), and an external SPI slave interface.
* **Build Files**: Constraints to map the design to the physical FPGA pins, and automation scripts for synthesis, routing, and flashing using an open-source toolchain.

## Memory Map

The SoC routes memory and data requests using a hardcoded address decoding scheme based on the highest bits of the 32-bit address.

* **`0x0000_0000` - Unified RAM**: The shared memory space for both instructions and data.
* **`0x8000_0000` - Board Peripherals**: Memory-mapped I/O for the physical board.
  * `Offset 0x00`: 7-Segment Displays
  * `Offset 0x04`: LEDs
  * `Offset 0x08`: Button Inputs
* **`0x8001_0000` - SPI Slave**: Custom SPI interface routing.
  * `Offset 0x00`: SPI Status (Chip Select state, New Data flag)
  * `Offset 0x04`: Received "Price" byte (from external master)
  * `Offset 0x08`: "Decision" byte (written by CPU to transmit)

Dive into the source code to see exactly how these components and connections are built under the hood!

## How to Build

To synthesize and build the project, you will need the open-source FPGA toolchain.

1. Install the tools by following the instructions at the [oss-cad-suite-build repository](https://github.com/yosyshq/oss-cad-suite-build).
2. Once installed, ~~blindly copy-paste~~ (we strongly encourage reading the Makefile first to make sure we aren't deleting your home directory) the following command in the project root to generate and program the final bitstream:

```bash
make all
